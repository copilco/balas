#summary Cylindrical Symmetry and 3D TDSE

= Introduction =

This library is created with the aim to solve numerically the time-dependent Schrodinger equation (TDSE) in cylindrical coordinates. The numerical integration of the TDSE allow us to study the laser-matter interaction and with it several physical processes, i.e., the electron ionization induced by a strong infrared laser field from atoms or molecules. 

Several physical problems can be addressed under the cylindrical symmetry if the laser electric field is linearly polarized along the longitudinal axis: "z". In this context, the wavefunction of the system can be described by two coordinates the "\rho" and "z", and the evolution of the wavefunction along the "\theta" coordinate is not taken into account. It is because throughout the time evolution, the magnetic quantum number (m=0) is equal to zero.
