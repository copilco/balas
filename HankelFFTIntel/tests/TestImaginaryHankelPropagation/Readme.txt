Test Imaginary Hankel Propagation
//////////////////////////////////

This test check the imaginary propagation of a Hankel wavefunction. 

For run the test, type in the terminal (at this folder as the working directory):

make ImaginaryHankelProp

To see the result, we have two MATLAB scripts:

- energia.m plots the evolution of the expected energy of the wavefunction.

- ReaderCylindrical2D makes a density plot of the evolution of the wavepacket.
