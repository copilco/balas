The most important series of test about how to implement the Hankel transformations
Also very important testings about how to make the matrx product using the slow index 
(the j in the j*Nt+i) in the blas routines. These tests are very important 
as the first index is used by the fftw routines and therefore that index is left for the 
fftw.

HankelGSLAccelerate.cpp is the main test of the routines and should be
calibrated against the matlab scripts  Calibration/hankel_example

In these matlab files, there is some explanation about the meaning of 
the arrays f,F,F2,f2, Fretrieved and fretrieved. By running first the
HankelGSLAccelerate.cpp and then the matlab files, some plots 
showing coincident dots should appear.

HankelGSL HankelAccelerate2.cpp and HankelAccelerateGaussian.cpp are further
test of the Hankel routines.

In all of these implementations, there are two arrays for each complex
quantity and the products are made of two real matrix arrays. The file
arrai.h provides the implementation of the basic arrays but as doubles.

HankelGSLAccelerateRows.cpp shows how to implement the matrix product 
in the second index, this is very important for the finel implementation.
