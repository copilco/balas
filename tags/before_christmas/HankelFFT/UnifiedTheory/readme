These are the files where the test for the comple Hankel+FFT implementation is made.
The first important thing is the creation of the fftw_complex arrai to make place
for the fft in all arrays.

Then the matrix multiplication is made with the the complex routine of the cblas and
is made over the slow index to let space for the use of the 1D FFT transformation.

The final versions are now into TestingHankelFourier1-5.cpp. The movies can be read with 
the movie matlab script.

There is one version of the TDSE which should be finished soon.

The arrai.h file is made with complex fftw and therefore are ready to FFT
